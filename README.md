A parallel out-of-core renderer with data load-balancing using the c-Collision protocol

This framework will serve as a foundation for my diploma-thesis. This project WAS under strong construction and WAS subject to frequent change.

Requirements to get this baby to compile: 
* a decent linux system running X 
* boost-lib (Version 1.38.0) 
* openMPI-lib (v1.3.1) 
* a decent nvidia GPU (at least with ShaderModel 3) 
* OpenGL >= 2.0 
*freeglut-lib (v2.4.0) 
* alternatively: GLFW (http://glfw.sourceforge.net) 
* glew-lib (v1.5.1) 
* nvidia's cg-toolkit (v2.1) 
* LUA to script the load-balancing strategies (v5.1.4)

Recommendations: 
* doxygen - to compile the documentation (v1.5.8) 
* latex - to get nice formula-images in the documentation 
* eclipse-cdt ganymede for development - project dependencies are included (v5.0.2) 
* some free huuuuuge OBJ-Models from the web to render (like the PowerPlant or even bigger) 
* spacenav-lib - to use a 3Dconnexion 3D-Mouse (http://spacenav.sourceforge.net)
